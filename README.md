The goal of the project is to improve the wellbeing of elderly people. This would be accomplished through dealing with dementia, and critical heart conditions. 

The dementia would be addressed by creating motion sensors with prerecorded messages, for example when a person walks to the door it plays a message to remind the person to lock the door. Also a gps locator for things like wallet, keys, and so on. Also creating an app that can be accessed by both the user and the friends/family to set up reminders and to see the user movements in the last few hours. 

There will be a heart sensor that monitors the patient, and in the case of a heart attack it would: 

  1) send a signal to the ambulance; 
  
  2) communicate with family; 
  
  3) unlock the door and sound the alarm for immediate assistance from neighbors. 

In the case of mild symptoms it would try to relax the user by interacting (guiding the user through the correct medical activities) with him and changing the environment by reducing the light, playing relaxing music and so on.
