# EQ
The goal of the project is to give support to people with a disease like dementia or Alzheimer, making them able to continue living at home by themselves.
Emergency Quest also aims to support the patient in carrying out everyday tasks and activities, to enhance his safety, and to monitor his health.

The main problems that the system embraces are:

1) Helping managing some of the potential risks around the home for the patient safety

More than half of patients with dementia or Alzheimers exhibit some type of "agitation" behavior. The best way to manage agitation is through environmental and atmosphere change. The system will monitor the patient, in case of agitation patient's caregivers will be notificated and advised and the system would try to relax the user by interacting (guiding the user through the correct medical activities) with him and changing the environment by controlling lighting, playing relaxing music.

2) Supporting the dementia patients to live at home by themselves

The motion sensors around the house will enable prerecorded messages that would help the patient to remember habitual activities like locking the door, turning off the oven.
Other reminder would be the set of pre-recorded messages that would be programmed at certain time, like a phone calendar, reminding the patient the realization of daily important activities.

The system will also implement a GPS because the disorientation of the disease often leads to wandering, a common and serious concern for many caregivers. This type of technology can let a caregiver know if the patient has left a certain area or it can show the patient his daily track and the places he have gone.
