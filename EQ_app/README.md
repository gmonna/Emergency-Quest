This is the mobile application written in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript/jQuery, that uses AJAX to communicate with the main server storing all user data.

With Adobe PhoneGap tool, a webapp like that can be translated in a native app for almost every mobile OS (we created only .ipa for iOS and .apk for Android).

All application content is located in the www folder, while config.xml and plugins and hook folders are requested by PhoneGap to create bundle.
